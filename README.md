Context
-------

This project's goal is to create a (simplified) clone of _Final Fantasy_'s combat, a game developed
by [_Square Enix_](https://www.square-enix.com)
Broadly speaking for the combat the player has a group of characters to control and a group of 
enemies controlled by the computer.

---

The project is built under the Model-View-Controller software arquitecture pattern, also following 
SOLID principles, along with others programming paradigms. 
The project got started by programming the model first. It consists on the characters and the weapons 
they may equip. Those entities are coded in such hierarchy that allows future extensions without
altering, in a major way, already written code.
