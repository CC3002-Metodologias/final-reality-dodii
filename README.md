Context
-------

This project's goal is to create a (simplified) clone of _Final Fantasy_'s combat, a game developed
by [_Square Enix_](https://www.square-enix.com), as a part of the work assigned by CC3002 Design
and Programming Methodologies college course.
Broadly speaking for the combat the player has a group of characters to control and a group of 
enemies controlled by the computer.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Gradle Build Tool.
Java
JUnit

Recommended: 
- Java 11 or superior.
- JUnit 5.0 or superior.
- IntelliJ IDE.

### Installing

Cloning the repository onto your computer, then opening the project using an IDE that
supports the recommended Java version.

## Running the tests

Executing the gradle build will run the testing process.
On a side note, sometimes the gradle build doesn't execute any of the tests, so executing it only once 
and then running the build again should solve this. This might be related to compatibility issues 
with my personal machine.

## General Summary

The project is built under the Model-View-Controller software arquitecture pattern, also following 
SOLID principles, along with others programming paradigms, containing an exhaustive amount of tests
to ensure a solid, functional result. 

## Model Summary
The project got started by programming the model first. It consists on the characters and the weapons 
they may equip. Those entities are coded in such hierarchy that allows future extensions without
altering, in a major way, already written code.
